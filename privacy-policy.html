<h1><span style="color: #000000;">PRIVACY POLICY</span></h1>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">OBS Publisher provides this Privacy Policy to inform users of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information received from users of OBS Publisher's&nbsp;websites, located at the domains: Hellskitchenrecipes.com, Homechefninja.com, Uberkitchn.com,&nbsp;Preparedforthat.com (the "OBS Publisher Websites"). Please note that this Privacy Policy only applies to the OBS Publisher Websites.</span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">Information Collection and Use</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">It is unnecessary to provide OBS Publisher with your personally identifiable information to use the OBS Publisher Websites. Unless you subscribe to an OBS Publisher newsletter, OBS Publisher does not collect personally identifiable information concerning the operation of the OBS Publisher Websites. Suppose you contact OBS Publisher by email through the OBS Publisher Websites. In that case, OBS Publisher may keep a record of your contact information and correspondence and may use your email address and any information you provide to OBS Publisher in your message to respond to you. OBS Publisher treats this information as it would treat any other unsolicited business correspondence and has no obligation to keep it confidential or take any security measures to protect it.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">If you subscribe to an OBS Publisher newsletter, you must provide us with your email address. We will use the email address you provide to subscribe to our newsletter(s) to send you the newsletter(s), marketing or promotional opportunities from us and our partners we believe may interest you, and certain administrative communications regarding the newsletters. We will not sell or rent your email address to anyone else for their marketing. You may unsubscribe from any or all of our newsletters or marketing communications at any time using the link provided in the email, and we will delete your email address from our records.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">When you visit an OBS Publisher Website, OBS Publisher's&nbsp;servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type or the domain from which you are visiting. For most users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider, the IP address will differ every time you log on. OBS Publisher uses Log Data to monitor the use of the OBS Publisher Websites and the services we offer via the OBS Publisher Websites and for the OBS Publisher Website's technical administration.</span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">Cookies and Other Analytic Tools</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Like many websites, OBS Publisher Websites also use "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve the OBS Publisher Website and the services offered via the Web Site. A cookie is a small data file that OBS Publisher's&nbsp;servers transfer to your computer's hard disk. OBS Publisher may also use tracking pixels. Tracking pixels are small graphic images used in email messages to determine whether the messages were opened and the links were clicked or are used on the OBS Publisher Websites to collect information about the browser and device viewing the OBS Publisher Websites. OBS Publisher does not use cookies or tracking pixels to collect personally identifiable information.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">OBS Publisher mainly uses "session cookies," which enable certain features of the OBS Publisher Websites and services offered via the OBS Publisher Websites to understand better how you interact with the Websites and services we offer via the OBS Publisher Websites, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the OBS Publisher Websites, and to improve the OBS Publisher Websites and services offered via the OBS Publisher Websites. Session cookies should be deleted from your computer when you disconnect or leave the OBS Publisher Websites.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">OBS Publisher also uses a persistent cookie on some of the OBS Publisher Websites that stay on your computer for some time after you leave the OBS Publisher Websites for the sole purpose of ensuring that where rating, voting, or survey functions are available, you do not participate more than once.</span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">Third-Party Advertisers</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">OBS Publisher Websites includes advertising from third-party advertisers. OBS Publisher does not provide any personally identifiable information to these advertisers.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Third-party advertisers, or companies working on their behalf, may serve directly to your browser the advertisements that appear on the OBS Publisher Websites, which allows them to receive Log Data (as defined above). They may also use cookies, JavaScript, tracking pixels and other technologies to measure their ads' effectiveness and personalize advertising content. OBS Publisher does not control any third-party advertiser tracking or measurement technologies, and this Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices of third-party advertisers. Please get in touch with them directly for more information about their privacy practices.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Our advertising partners may include Facebook and Twitter. Facebook allows its users to control advertising on the Facebook platform. Instructions are here:&nbsp;<a style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217</a>. Twitter allows its users to control advertising and cookie preferences on the Twitter service. Instructions are here:&nbsp;<a style="color: #000000;" href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-cookies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-cookies.</a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">To learn more about interest-based advertising or to opt out of this type of advertising by those third parties that are members of self-regulatory programs such as the Network Advertising Initiative, please visit the NAI's website&nbsp;<a style="color: #000000;" href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://optout.networkadvertising.org/</a>, which will allow you to opt out of Interest-Based Advertising by one, or all, NAI members. Similarly, information regarding opting out of targeted advertising by Digital Advertising Alliance members can be found here:&nbsp;<a style="color: #000000;" href="https://optout.aboutads.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://optout.aboutads.info</a>.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">You can also turn off all cookies (which will affect the functionality of most websites) or only third-party cookies, which may affect the functionality of some websites. Most advertisers use third-party cookies.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Then, if you know which cookies you want to delete, you can delete those, or you can delete all of your cookies (which, again, will affect the functionality of most websites&mdash; for example, you may lose your login status).</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">You have to repeat the cookie management process for each browser you use. From our perspective, each browser is a separate device, and we do not use, track, or store any data from mobile browsers.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">If you choose not to receive tracking pixels, you will need to turn off HTML images in your email program and browser, but that may affect images in other emails you receive and the web pages you browse.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">OBS Publisher also uses analytics technologies such as Google Analytics, Quantcast and comScore. For Google's privacy practices, see&nbsp;<a style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html</a>,&nbsp;and to opt out of data recording and analysis by Google Analytics on the OBS Publisher Websites, see&nbsp;<a style="color: #000000;" href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>. For Quantcast's privacy practices, see&nbsp;<a style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.quantcast.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.quantcast.com/privacy</a>, and to opt out of receiving interest-based content and ads enabled by Quantcast, see&nbsp;<a style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.quantcast.com/opt-out" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.quantcast.com/opt-out</a>. For comScore's privacy practices, see&nbsp;<a style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.comscore.com/About-comScore/Privacy-Policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.comscore.com/About-comScore/Privacy-Policy</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.scorecardresearch.com/privacy.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.scorecardresearch.com/privacy.aspx</a>, and to opt out of having comScore associate site visits with your browser, see&nbsp;<a style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.scorecardresearch.com/preferences.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.scorecardresearch.com/preferences.aspx</a>.</span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">California Consumer Privacy Act</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">By the California Consumer Privacy Act legislation, compliance information and any user actions are available here:&nbsp;<a style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.static.com/ccpa">Addendum A &ndash; Special Information Regarding California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</a>.</span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">Do Not Track</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Some web browsers may transmit "do not track" signals to the websites and other online services with which the browser communicates. OBS Publisher will treat a "do not track" signal as a request not to track the user for advertising purposes. For more information regarding Do Not Track mechanisms, see&nbsp;<a style="color: #000000;" href="https://allaboutdnt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allaboutdnt.com</a>.</span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">United States Operation; International Rights;</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Our Services are operated from the United States, and the privacy laws of the United States may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to use the Services or provide your information to us, you agree that your information will be transferred, processed, and stored there. Your use of the Services represents your agreement to this practice. However, our collection, storage, and processing of your personal information will always be by this Privacy Policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Further, under the applicable laws of various countries, you may have certain rights concerning your data, such as under EU law, the right to access to, rectification or erasure of, and restriction of processing or objection to the processing of your data, and the right to data portability. If you have questions about our collection or processing of your data, please get in touch with us at&nbsp;<a style="color: #000000;" href="mailto:privacy@static.com">privacy@obspublisher.com</a>. Before we process any request, we may request personal information to verify your identity where allowed by law. Where permitted by local law, we may reject unreasonable or impractical requests.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">If you are a resident of the European Union, you also have the right to complain to EU data protection authorities at no cost. This right may also exist in other countries. If you have questions, please ask the data protection authority in your country.</span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">Information Sharing and Disclosure</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">OBS Publisher cooperates with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law. OBS Publisher may disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as OBS Publisher, in its sole discretion, believes necessary or appropriate to respond to claims, legal processes (including subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of OBS Publisher or a third party, the safety of the public or any person, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, or to comply with the law.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Suppose any or all of the assets of OBS Publisher are acquired by or merged with another entity. In that case, the OBS Publisher will share some or all of the information collected through the OBS Publisher Websites with this entity.</span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">Security</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Because OBS Publisher does not collect any personally identifiable information from the OBS Publisher Websites, OBS Publisher does not take any specific security measures to protect the information we collect.</span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">Links to Other Sites</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">OBS Publisher Websites may contain links to other websites ("Linked Sites") operated by OBS Publisher or third parties. Linked Sites may place their cookies or other files on your computer to collect data or solicit personal information. This Privacy Policy addresses only the use and disclosure of information that OBS Publisher collects through the OBS Publisher Websites. Other sites follow different rules regarding using or disclosing the personal information you submit to them. OBS Publisher does not exercise control over third-party Linked Sites. Your use of any Linked Site operated by OBS Publisher is subject to the terms and conditions provided by OBS Publisher for such Linked Site. OBS Publisher encourages you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.</span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">Our Policy Towards Children</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">OBS Publisher Websites are not directed to children under 18. Suppose a parent or guardian becomes aware that their child has provided the OBS Publisher with personally identifiable information without their consent. In that case, they should contact OBS Publisher at&nbsp;<a style="color: #000000;" href="mailto:privacy@static.com">privacy@obspublisher.com</a>. If OBS Publisher becomes aware that a child under 13 has provided OBS Publisher with personally identifiable information, OBS Publisher will remove such information from our files.</span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">Changes to this Privacy Policy</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">OBS Publisher reserves the right to change this policy without prior notice. Any changes to this policy will be posted here. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.
